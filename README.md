# kitchen-fish

Generates a [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com) command line completion file for
[Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/).

You should have [ChefDK](http://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) installed.

Run the default recipe with chef-client local mode and you'll get a file in
~/.config/fish/completions/kitchen.fish.

This probably isn't much use to you unless you're me, creating this pull
request: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/2000, but if you're
hacking on those completions to make them better, this is the place.
